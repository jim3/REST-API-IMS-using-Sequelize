## RESTful API Inventory App for Fasteners

### Description

A RESTful API for an inventory management application for parts (fasteners). Express.js handles the routing and server-side logic. Sequelize ORM is used to interact with a SQLite3 database. 
The focus of the project is to learn more about how to build RESTful API's. There is a front-end for the parts inventory to demonstrate how the API works. Things I plan to implement in 
the future are listed at the bottom of the README.


### Features

-   Create, Read, Update and Delete parts (CRUD)

### Tech Stack

-   Node.js
-   Express
-   Sequelize ORM
-   SQLite3
